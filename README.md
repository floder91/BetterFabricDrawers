### Drawers
Drawers are blocks that can store a lot of a few items. They can be interacted with in world or using hopper or pipes from other mods.

They only support insertion in world, but can be extracted from using pipes
and hoppers.

for insertion and expansion of that resource.

### Locking
You can use a lock on drawers to make them keep their selected item even when empty.

### Voiding mode
If sneak clicked with a lava bucket, drawers will start voiding excess items

### Hidden mode
Hide icons on drawers to reduce lag or hide your valuables. Remember, anyone can change it.
